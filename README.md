Once you open the project in XCode, no additional set up is needed. Use the standard steps to:

## Testing
Please test all of your code before making a PR. There are no in-built unit tests right now. 

## Usage
// TODO: add demo link
Watch this demo here of how the app works. 

## Architechture
- The project doesn't have a database. All events and settings are stored in UserDefaults. This is done using the external [Defaults](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Defaults) package.
- There is a weak separation in terms of Model and View. 

## Libraries and Frameworks
- [Defaults](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Defaults) for storing all user data. It is basically a sugar coated UserDefaults. 
- [WishKit](https://www.wishkit.io) for colleting using feedback. Users can suggest or vote for new features. 

## Design
- All design and brainstorming is done in Sketch. Please contact Vicki (see Meta info section) if you want to be added to the Sketch project.
- The app icons were designed using Figma. 

## Team task collaboration tools
